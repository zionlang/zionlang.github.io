    <h1>Zion Language</h1>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zionlang/zion/master/zion.jpg">
    <p>Zion is a programming language. Zion prefers correctness and readability over performance. Zion targets scenarios
    where scalability is intended to happen horizontally, not vertically. That being said, Zion tries to be fast, using
    static compilation to native host architecture as its execution model. Zion is built on
    <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>.</p>
